## Problem Statement

Two files of 2D data points are provided in the form of CSV files. The data represents measurements of a projectile with different noise levels and is shown
in figure 1. Assuming that the projectile follows the equation of a parabola,

* Find the best method to fit a curve to the given data for each case. You have to plot the data and your best fit curve for each case. Submit your code along with the instructions to run it.
* Briefly explain all the steps of your solution and discuss why your choice of outlier rejection technique is best for that case.
